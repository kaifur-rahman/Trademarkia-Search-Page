## ‚öôÔ∏è <b>Deployment and CORS Instructions</b>

<h3>Running Locally</h3>
<p>If you'd like to run this project locally, follow the steps mentioned in the <b>Installation and Setup</b> section below. However, note that if you run the project locally, you may encounter <b>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</b> issues due to API restrictions.</p>

<p><b>To resolve this issue during local development:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the <b>CORS Unblock Chrome extension</b> from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/" target="_blank">this link</a>.</li>
  <li>After installing, make sure to <b>toggle the extension ON</b> while working on this project locally.</li>
  <li>This will temporarily bypass the CORS restrictions in your browser for testing purposes.</li>
</ol>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Note:</b> You should not need this extension when using the live demo link as the app is configured correctly in production.</p>
